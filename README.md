MDIA-3109 Advanced Dynamic Content Design
Punch-up! proposal

This punch-up focuses on enhancing my portfolio website by introducing animation element:
I will design my portfolio website homepage with an animated website background.
Currently, my homepage is just showing my name and position statically, so that I have got some feedbacks such as "it's boring" and "it would better if it has more interactive with users".
To enhance this problem, I decided to add an animated website background rather than animation objects.
Becuase my portfolio is desigend based on Minimal style with simple lines and grayscale colors.


Key Concepts:
Fly birds on the homepage, and avoiding mouse cursor.

Concerns
Controlling the quantity, birdsize, wingspan, speedlimit, separation, alignment and etc of birds.
Need to figure out how to deal with mobile enviornment due to "no mouse on mobile and tablets".
