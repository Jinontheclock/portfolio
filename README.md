MDIA-3109 Advanced Dynamic Content Design
Punch-up! proposal

2 Objects
This punch-up focuses on enhancing my portfolio website by introducing two key interaction elements:
1.	Loading Transition (Page-to-Page Motion Experience)
I will design a motion-graphic-based loading transition that appears between page navigations. Instead of a blank or static loading state, the transition will function as an engaging visual moment inspired by interactive references such as bleibtgleich.com.
2.	Interactive Homepage Animation (Mouse Cursor-based Interaction)
I will implement a cursor-responsive interactive effect on the homepage, allowing users to actively engage with the interface. This interaction will be inspired by experimental UI motion techniques demonstrated in creative coding tutorials.

•	From Passive to Interactive Experience
Most portfolio websites are primarily static and one-directional. By introducing cursor-based interaction, users can actively engage with the content, creating a more memorable and immersive experience.
•	Improved UX Through Transition Design
My current portfolio contains heavy assets (PDF viewers, images, videos, and demo apps), which results in noticeable loading delays. The loading transition will transform this limitation into a designed experience, making wait time feel intentional and visually engaging rather than frustrating.
•	Strengthening My Identity as a UI/UX Designer
These additions will demonstrate my ability to integrate motion, interaction, and user-centered thinking—positioning my portfolio not just as a showcase, but as an experience that reflects my design perspective.

Concepts
	•	Loading Transition
	•	Full-screen overlay during page navigation
	•	Motion-driven graphics (simple shapes / typography animation)
	•	Smooth entry → short visual sequence → reveal next page
	•	Homepage Interaction
	•	Cursor movement triggers visual distortion or particle-like motion
	•	Elements react dynamically to hover or proximity
	•	Subtle but playful interaction layer over existing layout

Resources
	•	JavaScript animation techniques (GSAP or similar libraries)
	•	Next.js for handling page transitions and routing behavior
	•	Creative coding tutorials for cursor-based interactions
	•	Existing portfolio codebase (React-based structure)

Concerns
	•	Technical Complexity
Implementing smooth page transitions within a framework like Next.js may require deeper understanding of routing and state management.
	•	Refactoring Existing Code
The homepage interaction may require significant restructuring of the current codebase, making this the most time-intensive part of the project.
	•	Performance Balance
While adding motion and interaction, I need to ensure that performance does not degrade further, especially given the already heavy content.
	•	Execution Quality
There is uncertainty about whether I can fully achieve a polished and seamless interaction at my current skill level, but this challenge is also part of the learning goal.
